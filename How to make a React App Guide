This file contains how to create a react app. 

1) Install NodeJS and Npm

2) If NPM folder is not in AppData, you have to manually make an NPM folder here: C:\Users\ashu0\AppData\Roaming\npm

Remember that AppData is a hidden folder, so you will have to show hidden folders.  

3) Go to powershell or command line (run as adminstrator): 

On your desktop make a project called react app and then navigate to it using powershell.  Inside of this path

PS C:\Users\ashu0\Onedrive\desktop\React Project> npx create-react-app my-blog

That's it!

Finally, navigate to my-blog folder and then in powershell: 

PS C:\Users\ashu0\Onedrive\desktop\React Project\my-blog> npm start

This will start the react app.
